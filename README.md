# Python_for_AI_seminar_crashcourse
It consists of beginner python crash course and introduction to important libraries such as numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
I use this note book to teach undergrad electrical engineering students interested in pursuing AI for power systems

I also use it to introduce tensorflow and keras for image classification
